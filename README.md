# Amin Nateghi - Personal Website

This repository contains the source code for my personal website. Built with Astro, the site features both light and dark mode support. I've also implemented a custom Aurora background effect, which can be toggled on or off according to your preference.

You can view the live site at: [https://nateghi.xyz/]
